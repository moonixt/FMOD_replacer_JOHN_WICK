Bring the intensity of John Wick into your Police HQ. This mod replaces the default Club music in Ready or Not with two of the most iconic and adrenaline-fueled tracks from the John Wick soundtrack. Whether you're preparing for a mission or roaming the HQ, these tracks will pull you straight into the high-stakes world of the Baba Yaga.

## Included Tracks:

John Wick Mode
LED Spirals

## Audio Editing:

All audio files were carefully processed using Audacity to ensure they fit seamlessly into the game’s environment. This includes:

Clean cuts and looping to match the game's background music system
Custom fade-outs to prevent harsh stops or transitions
Low-pass effect to simulate the distance between the club
Each track was edited to maintain its energy and cinematic impact while working smoothly within the club's ambient space.
